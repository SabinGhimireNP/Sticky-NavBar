# Sticky NavBar

Today's project was one of the easiest for me ðŸ˜Š.  
The main goal of the project was to fix a navbar after I scroll past it.  

To tackle this project, I calculated `window.scrollY` and `navBar.offsetTop`, and toggled a class that adds or removes the fixed position on the navbar ðŸ”§.

I also added a small meme / Easter egg ðŸ¥šðŸ˜„ for you guysâ€”look out for it!  
Let me know if you get the reference I made ðŸŽ¬ðŸ‘€.
